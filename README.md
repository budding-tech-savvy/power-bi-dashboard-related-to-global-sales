# power-bi-dashboard-related-to-global-sales
here, I have created a blooming dashboard as per my cognitive talent. my prime focus to create this pictorial visual was to showcase icons.
I wanted to sprinkle some icons to make this representation very magnificent. because always dashboard should be insightful which could give profit to the company.
here, what sorts of features i have used to make this dashboard more watchable. such features are:-
1. scatter plot chart 
because I wanted to represent my all information in animate formation.
2. matrix table :
matrix table has been inserted to show the names of all states, profit column, sales column, and so on.
3. sparkle line:
sparkle line used by me which marks the fluctuation in profit including the date.
4. image :
here, I have included a wide variety of pictures to  beautify this visual
5. conditional formatting:
in the matrix table, some of the conditional formattings has been added to show which stated has the highest value and lowest value.
